        <h2>Q&A</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>What is a handfasting?</h3>
            <p>
              A Handfasting is a Wiccan ceremony that binds a couple together.
              Traditionally, a couple would have a handfasting for a year and a
              day, after which a second handfasting would permanently seal their
              marriage.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>What do I need to know to participate in the ceremony?</h3>
            <p>
              Wiccan ceremonies are usually held in a circle. You can
              participate by focusing positive thoughts towards the couple when
              the circle is cast. Our circle will be created with incense powder
              which you may notice on the ground around the ceremony area. It is
              important not to disturb the incense powder and to not leave the
              circle once it is cast. If you must leave the circle, please exit
              at the back of the middle aisle where the gatekeeper will cut you
              out of the circle in a way that does not disturb the energy. There
              will also be opportunities to participate with important chants or
              spells.
            </p>

              How will I know the words to participate in chants or spells?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The text of the ceremony will be provided in the program along
              with text and pronunciations for sections where attendees can
              participate. Chants will be sung through three times, first by the
              officiant alone and twice more by everyone.
